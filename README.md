<p id="description">Password Analyzer &amp; Generator is a user-friendly Python desktop application built with Tkinter that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords using entropy calculations. It classifies passwords as Weak Moderate or Strong based on their complexity and length. In addition it features a strong password generator that creates secure random passwords of customizable length ensuring inclusion of uppercase lowercase digits and special characters. Users can export detailed analysis reports as PDF files and copy suggested passwords easily to the clipboard. This tool is perfect for anyone wanting to improve their password security habits with clear actionable feedback and convenient password creation.</p>
